Iris Classification – Learning Project
This project uses the Iris dataset to practice basic machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree Classifier
Evaluations include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

This is a learning project and NOT part of my professional portfolio.
